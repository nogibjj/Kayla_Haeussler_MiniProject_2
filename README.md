The purpose of this assignment was to create a  Python template to be used for future projects with best practices in place for testing, development and deployment.


# Requirements
- Python script using Pandas for descriptive statistics
- Read a dataset (CSV or Excel)
- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Create at least one visualization

The main function (defined in main.py) is the add function, which takes two variables, num1 and num2, and returns their sum. Tests for this function are defined in test.py

In order to use this template, load the repository to codespace or your local machine
